    "text": "The folders inside this folder should contain all data at various stages.\nThis data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the code folders.\nYou should place the raw data in the raw_data folder and not edit it. Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/taylorglass/Documents/MADA /corahirst-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Lastly, any time variable counting days post inoculation, lethal_day, wt_loss_day, and temp_day are integers, as days are counted discretely.\nHA and NA., referring to the head and neuraminidase subtypes of the virus used in each observation, were loaded as character. While they are character variables inherently, different virus can have different combinations of HA and NA, and can be grouped by either. The type of units titres were measured with, units, is also a categorical variable, as observations can contain one of two values, “EID” or “PFU”. Thus, we can treat units, HA, and NA. as categorical, and factor them.\nAll binary variables - lethal, HPAI, and HPAI_MBAA - are loaded as characters and not as logical. We can fix that, too.\nThe following code chunk factors the categorical variables and replaces binary character variables with logical values.\n\n# first, lets factor categorical variables\nferret_IAV_data = ferret_IAV_data %>%\n  mutate(\"units\" = factor(units), \"HA\" = factor(HA), \"NA.\" = factor(NA.)) \n\n# now, lets replace binary character variables with logical

:)\n\nNow, let’s think about our units variable. “PFU” and “EID50” are both measurements of virus titres, but come from different titration methods - essentially, this means that they cannot be compared.\nI’d like to make some correlations between virus titres and other variables included in the dataset. I can’t do that with a mixture of titration methods! So, I am only going to include observations where viral titres were measured via the titration method with the greatest number of observations.\nIn the following code chunk, I determine which titration unit, “PFU” or “EID”, has the greatest number of observations. Then, I am going to filter my dataset to only include observations where titres are measured with that method. I’ll keep that variable around, though there will only be observations for one factor level, just as a reminder which units the titres are measured in.\n\n# which factor level of units has the greatest number of observations? \nunits.counts = (summary(ferret_IAV_data$units)) #a named vector of counts of the number of observations for each level of variable \"units\"\nwhich.units.max =

titrations were done in eggs!), so only observations where titres were measured in EID are being included in the processed dataset. Please note that all observations and variables remain in the file “cdc-exercise/data/IAV_morbidity_and_titer_measurements_ferrets.csv”, so we can reconduct this processing and analysis excluding all observations measured in EID instead, if we want!\nAt this point, we should have 438 observations remaining.\nLastly, looking at the column lethal_day, ferrets that survived there infection are given a 0 for lethal_day. But that will skew our data quite a bit toward early lethality! So, I want to replace all “0” values for lethal_day with “NA”.\n\nferret_IAV_data = ferret_IAV_data %>%\n  mutate(lethal_day = case_when(lethal_day == 0 ~ NA, .default = lethal_day))"

    "text": "This section is contributed by Taylor Glass.\nI am going to make a synthetic data set to mirror this descriptive analysis by selecting 12 variables used to create the descriptive plots. I need an ID for the inoculated Ferret, an ID for the Virus used to inoculate it, whether the infection was lethal, if the infection was lethal, when the ferret died (lethal_day), whether the virus is a highly virulant avian HPAI, if the virus is highly virulent HPAI, whether it has a multi-basic amino acid cleavage site at HA, or an HPAI_MBAA, the identity of the virus’s HA and NA subtypes, the maximum percentage wt_loss of the ferret and which day this maximum was measured (wt_loss_day), and the maximum temperature temp of the ferret and which day this maximum was measured (temp_day). I will not generate a time series column because the code included in the descriptive analysis is only a skeleton, so I would have nothing to compare it to.\nTo get started, I asked ChatGPT 3.5 to create R code for a synthetic data set with these 12 variables by copying the previous paragraph into the AI tool and specifically asking for R code.\n\n## load packages\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n## set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(123)\n\n## original R code provided by ChatGPT\n# set number of observations\nn <- 100\n# generate synthetic data\ndata <- tibble(\n  Ferret_ID = 1:n,\n  Virus_ID = sample(1:10, n, replace = TRUE),\n  lethal = sample(c(\"Yes\", \"No\"), n, replace = TRUE),\n  lethal_day = ifelse(lethal == \"Yes\", sample(1:10, n, replace = TRUE), NA),\n  HPAI = sample(c(\"Yes\", \"No\"), n, replace = TRUE),\n  HPAI_MBAA = ifelse(HPAI == \"Yes\", sample(c(\"Yes\", \"No\"), n, replace = TRUE), NA),\n  HA_subtype = sample(c(\"H1\", \"H3\", \"H5\", \"H7\", \"H9\"), n, replace = TRUE),\n  NA_subtype = sample(c(\"N1\", \"N2\", \"N5\", \"N7\", \"N9\"), n, replace = TRUE),\n  wt_loss = rnorm(n, mean = 20, sd = 5),\n  wt_loss_day = sample(1:10, n, replace = TRUE),\n  temp = rnorm(n, mean = 38, sd = 0.5),\n  temp_day = sample(1:10, n, replace = TRUE)\n)\n# print the first few rows of the synthetic dataset\nprint(head(data))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 12\n  Ferret_ID Virus_ID lethal lethal_day HPAI  HPAI_MBAA HA_subtype NA_subtype\n      <int>    <int> <chr>       <int> <chr> <chr>     <chr>      <chr>     \n1         1        3 No             NA No    <NA>      H9         N9        \n2         2        3 No             NA No    <NA>      H3         N7        \n3         3       10 Yes             7 No    <NA>      H1         N7        \n4         4        2 No             NA No    <NA>      H7         N7        \n5         5        6 Yes             1 Yes   No        H3         N9        \n6         6        5 Yes             9 No    <NA>      H3         N7        \n# ℹ 4 more variables: wt_loss <dbl>, wt_loss_day <int>, temp <dbl>,\n#   temp_day <int>\n\n\nThe head of the new synthetic data set indicates that the ifelse statements were successful because there are NA values in the ‘lethal_day’ and ‘HPAI_MBAA’ variables. This makes sense because not every ferret died and not every HPAI virus had a multi-basic amino acid cleavage site at HA.\nThis data set is sufficient for modeling the original data set, but I made a few modifications to make it more similar to the real data. I want to include the same number of observations as the original data set, which is an easy change. The original synthetic data included 10 different virus IDs, but there are 83 different viral strands included in the real data. The real HA variable is a factor with 6 levels, and the real NA variable is a factor with 7 levels. I added 1 option to the HA_subtype variable and 2 options to the NA_subtype variable. I updated the ‘wt_loss’ and ‘temp’ variables with the true means and standard deviations of the real data. The real study was conducted over 14 days, so I made that change as well for the ‘wt_loss_day’ and ‘temp_day’ variables.\nI returned to this code after generating the first few plots and added probabilities to the ‘lethal’ and ‘HPAI’ variables. I was originally getting an even distribution for both of these variables in the synthetic data, which does not accurately portray the real data. Adding these probabilities increased the accuracy of the synthetic data compared to the real data.\n\n# explore real data to make synthetic data more accurate \ndim(ferret_IAV_data)\n\n[1] 438

I will explore lethality first with a simple histogram. The synthetic data produced approximately 79 deaths and 360 survivals, and the real data only had 90 deaths compared to 348 survivals. After creating a boxplot to display how many days each ferret that died survived, the mean survival time was about 6 days for 79 lethal observations, compared to the real findings of a mean survival time around 7 days for 90 lethal observations.\n\n## create visualization of ferret death\nhist1 <- ggplot(data2, aes(x=lethal)) + \n            geom_bar() +\n            labs(x= \"Ferret Death\",\n                 y= \"Frequency\", \n                 title = \"Synthetic Data Ferret Death\")\nhist1\n\n\n\n## compare with the same plot of the real data\nplot1\n\n\n\n## create visualization of mean survival time among ferrets that died \nboxplot1 <- data2 %>% \n            filter(lethal == \"Yes\") %>% \n            ggplot() + \n            geom_boxplot(aes(y = lethal_day)) + \n            annotate(geom = \"text\", x = 0, y = 7.5, label = paste(sum(data2$lethal==\"Yes\"), \"lethal                         observations\")) +\n            labs(x = \"Ferret Death\",\n                 y = \"Days Survived\",\n                 title = \"Synthetic Data Days Survived\")\nboxplot1\n\n\n\n## compare with the same plot of the real data\nplot2\n\n\n\n\nI explored how many of the virulent strains are highly pathogenic in the synthetic data set next. The synthetic data showed 72 highly pathogenic HPAI strands among ferrets that died compared to 7 dead ferrets without highly pathogenic HPAI strands. This is similar to the 89 observations of highly pathogenic viruses in dead ferrets compared to 1 non-highly pathogenic virus in dead ferrets that was recorded in the real data set. The synthetic data differs from the real data when exploring how many ferrets infected with highly pathogenic HPAI strands. Only 72 ferrets infected with HPAI died and 323 survived compared to 89 ferrets infected with HPAI dying and 118 ferrets surviving in the real data set.\n\n## create visualization of dead ferrets with HPAI strands\nhist2 <- data2 %>%\n            select(\"HPAI\", \"lethal\") %>%\n            filter(lethal == \"Yes\") %>%\n            ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x = HPAI, y = (..count..)/sum(..count..))) + \n            stat_count(geom = \"text\", colour = \"black\", size = 3.5, aes(x = HPAI, label = paste(..count.., \"observations\"), y = ..count../(sum(data2$lethal==\"Yes\")))) +\n            labs(x = \"Highly Pathogenic HPAI\", \n                 y = \"Frequency\", \n                 title = \"Synthetic Data Dead Ferrets with Highly Pathogenic HPAI\")\nhist2\n\n\n\n## compare with the same plot of the real data\nplot3\n\n\n\n## create visualization of HPAI strands in dead ferrets\nhist3 <- data2 %>%\n            select(\"HPAI\", \"lethal\") %>%\n            filter(HPAI == \"Yes\") %>%\n            ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x = lethal, y = (..count..)/sum(..count..))) + \n            stat_count(geom = \"text\", colour = \"white\", size = 3.5, aes(x = lethal, label = paste(..count.., \"observations\"), y = ..count../(2*sum(data2$HPAI==\"Yes\")))) +\n            labs(x = \"Dead Ferrets\", \n                 y = \"Frequency\", \n                 title = \"Synthetic Data Percentage Ferrets Infected with Highly Pathogenic HPAI that Died\")\nhist3\n\n\n\n## compare with the same plot of the real data\nplot4\n\n\n\n\nI also wanted to explore a couple of the descriptive questions that were answered with the real data set. First, what is the distribution of NA and HA subtypes? How do those subtypes appear in combination? I had to add a new variable to the synthetic data set to mimic what was done to the real data set. These plots differ a lot between the synthetic data and the real data because the synthetic data has many more combinations of HA and NA subtypes with a much higher proportion of each subtype being classified as HPAI. I think the synthetic data created more subtypes that do not actually exist in the real world considering that there are only 15 subtype combination shown in the real data, which would explain why the distributions look different.\n\n# add new subtype variable\ndata2 <- data2 %>% \n          mutate(subtype = as.factor(paste0(HA_subtype,NA_subtype)))  \n\n# create visualization of viral subtype combinations and HPAI classification\nboxplot2 <- data2 %>%\n            ggplot() + \n            geom_bar(aes(x = subtype, y = ..count../sum(..count..), fill = HPAI)) +  #kept the same colors\n            stat_count(geom = \"text\", colour = \"white\", size = 2.5, aes(x = subtype, label = ..count.., y = ..count../(2*length(data2$subtype)))) +\n            labs(x = \"Subtype\", \n                 y = \"Proportion\", \n                 title = \"Synthetic Data Proportion of Inoculated Influenza A Subtypes\" )\nboxplot2\n\n\n\n## compare with the same plot of the real data\nplot8\n\n\n\n\nI explored how much weight loss each ferret exhibited and stratified that based on lethal status in the synthetic data as was done for the real data. The synthetic data plot shows a more consistence percentage of weight loss around 10% across the 14 day time period while the real data shows an increase in weight loss percentage over the first 4 days before the average hovers around 10% for the remainder of the time. Additionally, the real data boxplots show that ferrets that died had higher weight loss based on the blue dots, but that trend is not seen in the synthetic data. I think the reason for this discrepancy is that there is a correlation because weight loss and lethality that was not accounted for in the synthetic data.\n\n## create visualization of the weight loss in ferrets over 14 days\nboxplot3 <- ggplot() + \n            geom_boxplot(data = data2, aes(x = wt_loss_day, y = wt_loss, group = wt_loss_day)) +\n            geom_point(data = data2, aes(x = wt_loss_day, y = wt_loss, col = lethal), alpha = 0.5) +\n            labs( x = \"Day of Maximum Weight Loss\", \n                  y = \"Percentage Weight Loss\", \n                  title = \"Synthetic Data Max Percentage Weight Loss By Day\")\nboxplot3\n\n\n\n## compare with the same plot of the real data\nplot9\n\nWarning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, I would expect there to be no correlation between weight loss day and day of maximum temperature in the synthetic data because there is no correlation between these two variables in the real data. These expectation were met based on the ‘scatter1’ plot.\n\n## create visualization of correlation between weight loss day and maximum temperature day\nscatter1 <- ggplot() + \n            geom_point(data = data2, aes(x = wt_loss_day, y = temp_day, col = lethal))\nscatter1\n\n\n\n## compare with the same plot of the real data\nplot11 = ggplot() + geom_point(data = ferret_IAV_data, aes(x = wt_loss_day, y = temp_day, col = lethal))\n\nOverall, the synthetic data did a sufficient job of modeling the real data in terms of how many ferrets died and which ones had the highly pathogenic HPAI strands because the probability of each of these variables was accounted for. The least successful synthetic data plot came from subtypes of viral strands based on the different number of combinations between the synthetic and real data. I think this could be improved if there was a way to account for the 15 subtype combinations that actually exist in the real data."

Using a definition of \\(pvalue &lt; 0.05\\) as significance, it is evident that population size is a poor predictor of life expectancy (\\(p = 0.6 &gt; 0.05\\)). However, infant mortality is in fact a better, significant predictor of life expectancy (\\(p = 2 \\times 10^{-8}\\)) (Table 1, Table 2). Thus, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that life expectancy is not correlated with population size, but do reject the null hypothesis that life expectancy is not correlated with infant mortality rates.\n\nThis section is contributed by Taylor Glass."

    "section": "Synthetic Dataset Generation: High disease severity in patients is correlated with a longer time between infection and vaccination",
    "text": "Synthetic Dataset Generation: High disease severity in patients is correlated with a longer time between infection and vaccination\nThe chunk below simply sets a seed for reproducibility (I’d like for my probability function to assign the same numbers each time I run it), and defines the number of observations I’d like to generate in my dataset.\n\n# Set a seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Define the number of observations to generate\nn_patients &lt;- 100\n\nHere, I will be generating the dataset as a data.frame. The dataset will contain 5 variables: pat_ID will be a character variable storing the IDs of various patients; age will store the age of each of these patients, and I will restrict these ages between 10 and 100; time_post_vaccination will be a numeric variable storing the amount of time elapsed, in days, since the most recent vaccination; time_post_infection will be a numerical variable storing the amount of time elapsed, in days, since the approximate date at which the patient was infected; and finally, disease_severity will be a categorical variable storing an arbitrary measure of disease severity, ranked as an integer between 0 (asymptomatic) and 10 (death, sadly).\nI chose to create an association between the amount of time between the most recent vaccination and infection (hereon refered to as “time between”) and disease severity. The simplest way to do this, and the way I chose, is to treat the amount of time between the most recent vaccination and infection as proportional to the probability of severe disease.\nI decided that the individual with the greatest time between infection and vaccination would undoubtedly have the greatest disease severity. Technically, I divided the time between for each patient by the maximum time between among all patients (\\(\\frac{time \\ between}{max \\ time \\ between}\\)) - this is the probability of severe disease independent of other factors.\nHowever, I also want some association between age and the probability of severe disease; so, I define the actual probability of severe disease as \\(\\frac{time \\ between}{max \\ time \\ between} \\times \\frac{age}{max \\ age}\\). This way, the oldest individuals with he greatest time between infection and vaccination have the worst disease severity.\nThen, starting the disease severity of each individual at \\(0\\), I generate a random number between 0 and 1. If an individual’s probability of severe disease is greater than this randomly generated number, I add \\(1\\) to their disease severity. I do this 10 times, so the maximum possible disease severity is \\(10\\).\n\n## empty dataframe with n_patients observations \ndata = data.frame(\n  pat_id = character(n_patients), #patient ID\n  age = numeric(n_patients), #patient age\n  time_post_vaccination = integer(n_patients), #days elapsed since last vaccination \n  time_post_infection = numeric(n_patients), #days elapsed since infection\n  disease_severity = integer(n_patients) #on a scale from 1-10, how \"bad\" were illness symptoms\n)\n\n## populating the variables\n# patient id\ndata$pat_id = paste0(\"ID_\", sample(100:999, 100, replace=F) ) # each gets a 3-digit ID because I feel like it \n# patient age\ndata$age = c(sample(10:50, 30, replace=T), sample(51:100, 70, replace = T)) #I want to have more samples from age &lt; 50, and to not children under 10\ndata$time_post_infection = c(sample(7:60, 100, replace=T)) # between one week and two months\ndata$time_post_vaccination = data$time_post_infection + c(sample(30:200, 100, replace=T)) # all individuals had a vaccination between 1 month and 200 days before their infection \n\n### alright, now I want to make a correlation between disease severity in the time between vaccination and infection. That means I need to add a third column, time between vaccination and infection, and bias my samples of numbers 1:10 by that number. Then I'll delete that column so that the \"analyst\" has to think of it themselves muahahahaha\n\ndata$time_between = data$time_post_vaccination - data$time_post_infection #the bigger the difference, the greater the probability of getting 10\n\n## how to do disease severity? for loop 10 times. Probability of adding 1 is equal to (timebetween/maxtimebetween); thus, if a randomly generated number between 0 and 1 is less than this probability, we add 1 to disease severity. The longer between vaccine and infection, the worse protected we are! -&gt; sometime it would be cool to alter this so there is some penalty to getting infected immediatly after vaccination. :)\n\n## however, I also want some relationship between age and disease severity. So, I am going to reduce the \"effective\" time between vaccination and infection by age. \n\n# vector to store our simulated disease severities\ndisease_severities = rep(0, 100)\n\n# simulation to generate disease severities based on time between vaccination and infection \nfor(c in 1:10){\n  for(i in 1:n_patients){\n    prob = (data[i, \"time_between\"])/max(data$time_between)\n    age_adjust_prob = prob * (data[i, \"age\"])/max(data$age)\n    rand = runif(1, min = 0, max = 1)\n    if(age_adjust_prob &gt; rand){disease_severities[i] = disease_severities[i] + 1}\n  }\n  c = c+1\n}\n\n# add these disease severities to our dataset as FACTOR\ndata$disease_severity = factor(disease_severities)\n\n#finally, remove our \"time between\" category - though I'm just going to add it back in the next code chunk ;)\ndata = data[,!(names(data) %in% \"time_between\")]\n\n\n### and now we have our dataset!

Each colored point represents one patient.\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly, there is a correlation between age and disease severity (Figure 1.) Interestingly, the distribution of ages of patients with high disease severities is particularly narrow when compared to patients with lower disease severities; this can in part be attributed to a smaller representation of patients with high disease severity (Figure 2.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of patients with varying diseases severities. Blue line shows the mean disease severity across patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we also need to take into consideration that there are a large number of older patients (Figure 3), and a wider distribution of the older aged individuals across disease severity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Distribution of patients by age. Pink line shows the mean age across patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, there is likely some other variable influencing the number of patients with high disease severity. When I plot the correlation between age and disease severity and observe the associated time elapsed since last vaccination (Figure 4), it becomes apparent that higher disease severities are associated with longer times post vaccination (light colored dots).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Correlation between patient’s age and disease severity.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferring back to the generation of the dataset, I also introduced an association between the time between time_post_vaccination and time_post_infection and disease_severity. I expect that, without calculating and plotting this time difference itself against disease_severity, there should be some signal of the negative correlation in the plot of time_post_vaccination and disease_severity. Because time_post_vaccination has a wider range than time_post_infection, I anticipate it will have had a greater effect on the variation within the difference between time_post_vaccination and time_post_infection; thus, I expect this signal to be lost when plotting the relationship between time_post_infection and disease_severity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Correlation between the time elapsed since the individual’s last vaccination and disease severity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is, in fact, some positive correlation recovered between the time elapsed since a patient’s last vaccination and the severity of their disease (Figure 5.) However, the significance of this association is not apparent.\nLastly, I would also like to see if the time elapsed since being effected (how long the patient had been infected before the observation was made) has any visual effect- it’s important to see if my random sampling and pairing has generated any!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Correlation between the time elapsed since the individual’s infection and disease severity.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 demonstrates that there is little correlation between disease severity and the time elapsed since becoming infected.\n\nAlso greater variation in the ages of patients with lower disease severities than higher disease severities, and not just dependent upon fewer samples (more samples captured for older ages) -&gt; though may be a result of fewer samples for youths. Could check this out by exploring ages before and after the mean as independent datasets (for later!)"

Thus, either variable appears to be a pretty good predictor of disease severity.\nBut, we know from figures Figure 4 and, especially, Figure 5 that the interaction between these terms may be an even better predictor of disease severity. If our goal is to generate the best model to help predict the disease severity of a patient, we might want to fit a linear model with both of these variables as predictors.\nThe following code chunk fits this multi-variable linear model:\n\n# determine best fit models\nmodel1 = lm(as.numeric(levels(disease_severity))[disease_severity] ~ time_post_vaccination + time_post_infection + age, data=data)\n\n# generate tables to present\ntable1 = model1 %&gt;% gtsummary::tbl_regression() #save summaries as tables using tbl_regression() function from gtsummary package\n\n# save summary tables\nsummarytable_file = here(\"data-exercise\", \"tables\", \"lm_severity_all.rds\")\nsaveRDS(table1, file = summarytable_file)\n\n# extract p-values from summaries to display on figures\np.all = unname(summary(model1)$coefficients[,\"Pr(&gt;|t|)\"])[2]\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Linear regression model of disease severity by age, time elapsed since vaccination, and time elapsed since infection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nBeta\n95% CI\np-value\n\n\n\n\nage\n0.08\n0.06, 0.09\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis model also provides a significant p-value. But how different are the p-values for these three models: disease severity ~ age, disease severity ~ time post vaccination, and disease severity ~ age + time post vaccination + time post infection?\n\ncomparing p-values for different linear predictors of disease severity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nage\ntime_post_vaccination\nage + time_post_infection + time_post_vaccination\n\n\n\n\n\n5.7339746^{-14}\n2.5827222^{-15}\n4.3594356^{-17}\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like the multivariable linear regression of disease severity with age, time post vaccination, and time post infection fits the model significantly better than either age or time post vaccination alone.\nIf I were to receive this dataset without knowing the associations I built into (and if I weren’t particularly clever, jury’s out on that one!), I might stop there and say that either variable is a good predictor of illness.\nBut, I know that the true predictor of disease severity is the difference between time_post_vaccination and time_post_infection; that is, I wanted to generate the data so that individuals who were most recently vaccinated had a better disease outcome than those who were vaccinated a longer time before infection. In the following code chunk, I add the variable \\(diff_between\\) to the dataset - this is the time between vaccination and infection.\n\n# add variable for time between vaccination and infection \ndata$diff_between = data$time_post_vaccination-data$time_post_infection\n\n# determine best fit models\nmodel2 = lm(as.numeric(levels(disease_severity))[disease_severity] ~ diff_between, data=data)\nmodel3 = lm(as.numeric(levels(disease_severity))[disease_severity] ~ diff_between + age, data=data)\n\n# generate tables to present\n\ntable2 = model2 %&gt;% gtsummary::tbl_regression() #save summaries as tables using tbl_regression() function from gtsummary package\ntable3 = model3 %&gt;% gtsummary::tbl_regression() #save summaries as tables using tbl_regression() function from gtsummary package\n\n# save summary tables\nsummarytable_file = here(\"data-exercise\", \"tables\", \"lm_severity_diff_between.rds\")\nsaveRDS(table2, file = summarytable_file)\n\n# save summary tables\nsummarytable_file = here(\"data-exercise\", \"tables\", \"lm_severity_diff_between_age.rds\")\nsaveRDS(table3, file = summarytable_file)\n\n# extract p-values from summaries to display on figures\np.diff_between = unname(summary(model2)$coefficients[,\"Pr(&gt;|t|)\"])[2]\np.diff_between_age = unname(summary(model3)$coefficients[,\"Pr(&gt;|t|)\"])[2]\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Linear regression model of disease severity by difference betweem time of vaccination and time of infection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nBeta\n95% CI\np-value\n\n\n\n\ndiff_between\n0.04\n0.03, 0.05\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Linear regression model of disease severity by age and difference betweem time of vaccination and time of infection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nBeta\n95% CI\np-value\n\n\n\n\ndiff_between\n0.03\n0.03, 0.04\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nage\n0.06\n0.04, 0.07\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables Table 4 and Table 5 reveal that these models are also significant predictive models. Lets compare these fits with the best fit multi-variable model:\n\ncomparing p-values for different linear predictors of disease severity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nage + time_post_infection + time_post_vaccination\ndiff_between\ndiff_between + age\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3594356^{-17}\n1.1779262^{-16}\n2.3592392^{-17}\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the time between vaccination and infection (diff_between) is a better predictor of disease severity than either age or time elapsed since vaccination, though the mutli variable model with the three variable age, time_post_vaccination, and time_post_infection is still a better predictor than diff_between.\nHowever, the best predictor is actually the multi-variable model with fewer variables! diff_between and age predict disease severity better than all three variables, age, time_post_vaccination, and time_post_infection. Plus, we know (because I generated the model!) that there is some causal motivation for creating this fourth variable, diff_between."

The tricky thing is, we have so many fun ideas to play with, and now it’s the time to become more rigourous in that endeavour!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is me, holding a pumpkin spice latte in front of the Christmas lights at the farm near my home along the front range!\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a photo of my cat, Eigen, in Georgia…\n\n\nHe’s a rescue, with one eye, FIV, and a reset jaw. But he’s perfectly (purr-fectly?) happy and relatively healthy with the help of antibiotics, and sounds a little like Darth Vador when he breathes :) Plus, I’ve been interested in dynamical systems models of HIV infections, so to me, the little man is a treasure trove of interesting immunology!\n\n\n\n…and here’s one of my cat back in Denver.\n\n\nHe’s a rescue too (of sorts - we collected him as a kitten from a box in front of a grocery store.) Tails - named after the Sonic the Hedgehog character, which seven-year-old me was adament about explaining - has been a part of our family for nearly 16 years, and while he’s not the brightest bulb, he sure is fun to mess with!\n\n\n\nLastly, this is my roommate, Tracy, who is my best friend here in Georgia and is working her tailfeathers off to find an MD-PhD program for Orthopedics."

Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in.

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."
